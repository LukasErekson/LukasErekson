# Lukas Erekson 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about PostgreSQL, Redis, and `dotnet` cli tools.
- 👷 I'm currently working professionally with C#/Dotnet, SQL Server, and JavaScript.
- 🤔 I'm interested in mobile development, Rust 🦀, and Bash/Python scripting.

I have a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics, but my particular focus and interest has been in scientific computing and software development. I love all things automation and documentation.
