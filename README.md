# Lukas Erekson 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 👷 I'm currently working professionally with Python 🐍 and TypeScript (React.js) ⚛️
- 🤔 I'm interested in Rust, Ruby, and Web Development

I have a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics, but my particular focus and interest has been in scientific computing and software development. I love all things automation and documentation.

Here, you can find several of my repositories I created as an undergrad, projects to learn Ruby on Rails following [The Odin Project](https://www.TheOdinProject.com/), and doing my own thing here and there.
