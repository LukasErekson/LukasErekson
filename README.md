# Lukas Erekson 
## Accountant by day, Full-Stack Developer by Night

I'm Lukas Erekson, a full-time accountant learning full-stack web development. I have a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics, but my particular focus and interest has been in scientific computing and software development. I love all things automation and documentation.

Here, you can find several of my repositories I created as an undergrad as well as my more recent projects to learn Ruby on Rails following [The Odin Project](https://www.TheOdinProject.com/) and doing my own thing here and there.
